I have read a bunch of research papers in the past few years. But I fail to
remember most of them because of the lack of summary and better organization. It
is time to resume the research reading list for myself.

Although there are already several very good public reading lists about computer
networking, e.g., [Cristian Lumezanu][lume_home]'s [SDN Reading List][sdn_reading_list]
and [Richard Yang][yry_home]'s [Lecture][yale_cs434_2019_spring], they are so
general that they do not match my research interests very well.

[yale_cs434_2019_spring]: http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs434/cs434-2019-spring/schedule.shtml

Of course, it is hard to summarize a very comprehensive reading list
immediately. But by following my recent research topics, I will complete the
reading list little by little. And I will begin from the following topic: the
interdomain network optimization for large-scale data analytics systems.
