abstract: Data analytics tends to be geo-distributed, which means the intermediate
  data may distribute into different data centers. It requires tenants to launch coflows
  across WAN links. However, there is a gap between tenants and the SD-WAN controller.
  This gap makes existing SD-WAN bandwidth allocation mechanisms drive to bad performance
  at tenant level. To fit this gap, this paper presents COC, a novel SD-WAN bandwidth
  allocation framework using hierarchical coflow ordering, to efficiently improve
  the coflow completion time of each tenant.
