abstract: "As modern network applications (e.g., large data analytics) become more\
  \ distributed and can conduct application-layer traffic adaptation, they demand\
  \ better network visibility to better orchestrate their data flows. As a result,\
  \ the ability to predict the available bandwidth for a set of flows has become a\
  \ fundamental requirement of today's networking systems. While there are previous\
  \ studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive\
  \ flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains\
  \ an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput\
  \ prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control\
  \ mechanisms, and source-constrained flows. Based on a previous theoretical model,\
  \ we introduce a novel learning-based prediction system with a key component named\
  \ fast factor learning (FFL) model. We adopt novel techniques to overcome practical\
  \ concerns such as scalability, convergence and unknown system parameters. A system,\
  \ Prophet, is proposed leveraging the emerging technologies of Software Defined\
  \ Networking (SDN) to realize the model. Evaluations demonstrate that our solution\
  \ achieves significant accuracy in a wide range of settings."
