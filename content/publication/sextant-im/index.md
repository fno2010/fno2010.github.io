abstract: 'A growing trend is that network service providers and applications
  are integrated more closely through open APIs for better end-to-end
  performance. In particular, the provided-aided network information can help
  applications orchestrate their traffic for a better quality of experience,
  and is gaining a lot of attention from both the academia and the industry.
  However, enabling automated network-aware application optimization in
  todayâ€™s Internet is difficult because of the multivendor, multi-domain
  nature of carrier networks. In this paper, we introduce Sextant, a novel
  network information exposure system, taking a solid step towards enabling
  network-aware application optimization in carrier networks. Our work is
  driven by a real requirement from an international ISP, where timely,
  accurate distance information is critical to fully utilize its CDN caches
  deployed at different Point-of-Presence (PoP). We design a novel, flexible
  requirement model, allowing applications to specify their interests. The
  queries are efficiently carried out using our aggregation and incremental
  update algorithms. Evaluations demonstrate that our prototype system
  operates on top of real router software images, and can efficiently handle
  dynamics from multiple ASes.'
