abstract: Copyright Â© 2016 ACM. Transparent computing is an implementation of ubiquitous
  computing that is aimed at providing active services for users. In transparent computing,
  the execution (computation) of computer instructions and data is temporally and
  spatially separated from their storage. Cloud computing solves the issue of data
  cloudlization, while transparent computing solves the one of software cloudlization.
  This paper define the concept of Cloudware, and discusses how to deploy Cloudware
  in cloud environment efficiently. Based on a loosely coupled von Neumann computing
  model (also called Cygnus Model), we proposes a new platform to construct the PaaS
  platform which can directly deploy software on the cloud without any modification,
  while achieving a new model by the browser services, and we call it transparent
  computing 2.0. By using micro-service architecture, we can achieve such characteristics
  as good performance, scalable deployment, faults tolerance and flexible configuration.
  Finally, we presents a Cloudware PaaS platform prototype, called CloudwareHub, and
  demonstrates the promising of the transparent computing 2.0 with the support of
  Cloudware technology.
