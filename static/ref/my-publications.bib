  abstract  = {The stable path problem (SPP) is a unified model for analyzing the convergence of distributed routing protocols (e.g., BGP), and a foundation for many network verification tools. Although substantial progress has been made on finding solutions (i.e., stable path assignments) for particular subclasses of SPP instances and analyzing the relation between properties of SPP instances and the convergence of corresponding routing policies, the non-trivial challenge of finding stable path assignments to generic SPP instances still remains. Tackling this challenge is important because it can enable multiple important, novel routing use cases. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel data structure called solvability digraph, which encodes key properties about stable path assignments in a compact graph representation. Thus SPP is equivalently transformed to the problem of finding in the solvability digraph a maximum independent set (MIS) of size equal to the number of autonomous systems (ASes) in the given SPP instance. We leverage this key finding to develop a heuristic polynomial algorithm GREEDYMIS that solves strictly more SPP instances than state-of-the-art heuristics. We apply GREEDYMIS to designing two important, novel use cases: (1) a centralized interdomain routing system that uses GREEDYMIS to compute paths for ASes and (2) a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocol that allows ASes to use GREEDYMIS collaboratively to compute paths without exposing their routing preferences. We demonstrate the benefits and efficiency of these use cases via evaluation using real-world datasets.},

  abstract  = {Data analytics tends to be geo-distributed, which means the intermediate data may distribute into different data centers. It requires tenants to launch coflows across WAN links. However, there is a gap between tenants and the SD-WAN controller. This gap makes existing SD-WAN bandwidth allocation mechanisms drive to bad performance at tenant level. To fit this gap, this paper presents COC, a novel SD-WAN bandwidth allocation framework using hierarchical coflow ordering, to efficiently improve the coflow completion time of each tenant.},

@inproceedings{SDi,
  abstract  = {End-to-end route control spanning a set of networks can provide opportunities to both end users to optimize interdomain control and network service providers to increase business offering. BGP, the de facto interdomain routing protocol, provides no programmable control. Recent proposals for interdomain control, such as MIRO, ARROW and SDX, provide more mechanisms and interfaces, but they are only either point or incremental solutions. In this paper, we provide the first, systematic formulation of the software-defined internetworking (SDI) model, in which a network exposes a programmable interface to allow clients to define the interdomain routes of the network, just as a traditional SDN switch exposes Openflow or another programmable interface to allow clients to define its next hops, extending SDN from intra-domain control to generic interdomain control. Different from intradomain SDN, which allows complete client control, SDI should also maximize network autonomy, such as by allowing a network to maintain the control of its interdomain export policies, to avoid fundamental violations such as valley routing. We define the optimal end-to-end SDI routing problem and conduct rigorous analysis to show that the problem is NP-hard. We develop a blackbox optimization algorithm, which leverages Bayesian optimization theory and important properties of interdomain routing algebra, to sample end-to-end routes sequentially and find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route with a small number of sample routes. We implement a prototype of our optimization algorithm and validate its effectiveness via extensive experiments using real interdomain network topology. Results show that in an interdomain network with over 60000 ASes and over 320000 AS-level links, in 80% experiment cases, the blackbox optimization algorithm can find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route by sampling less than 33 routes.},

@article{Unicorn,
  abstract = {As the data volume increases exponentially over time, data-intensive analytics benefits substantially from multi-organizational, geographically-distributed, collaborative computing, where different organizations contribute various yet scarce resources, e.g., computation, storage and networking resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts of data. By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. We also give a full demonstration of the Unicorn system at SuperComputing 2017.},

  abstract  = {Multi-domain network resource reservation systems are being deployed, driven by the demand and substantial benefits of providing predictable network resources. However, a major lack of existing systems is their coarse granularity, due to the participating networks' concern of revealing sensitive information, which can result in substantial inefficiencies. This paper presents Mercator, a novel multi-domain network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource information, for collaborative sciences. The foundation of Mercator is a resource abstraction through algebraic-expression enumeration (i.e., linear inequalities/equations), as a compact representation of the available bandwidth in multi-domain networks. In addition, we develop an obfuscating protocol, to address the privacy concerns by ensuring that no participant can associate the algebraic expressions with the corresponding member networks. We also introduce a super-set projection technique to increase Mercator's scalability. Finally, we implement Mercator and demonstrate both its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real topologies and traces.},

While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control mechanisms, and source-constrained flows. Based on a previous theoretical model, we introduce a novel learning-based prediction system with a key component named fast factor learning (FFL) model. We adopt novel techniques to overcome practical concerns such as scalability, convergence and unknown system parameters.
