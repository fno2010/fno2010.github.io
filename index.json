Each author was required to host a Hubs VR room and present his/her work in his/her own VR room online. What does it mean? It means more workload! You have to set up a VR room besides your pre-print A0 poster.\nThe SIGCOMM poster/demo session took place over August 11-12 from 4:30pm-5:30pm ET. The time slots were friendly to me, as I was still stuck in US. But I believe they were not to many people in Asia.\nOverall, such a experiencement is interesting enough, although some of my audiences failed to join the VR room. I guess they were using some lower performance cellphones.\nThe SRC is also interesting enough. I met 3 or 4 jurors. Some of them did not just ask questions, but also gave some helpful comments. I really appreciate.\nI believe a major benefit of using the online room is that there is no limit about the place. It does not mean the room can hold unlimited number of audiences. It means the time slot is unlimited. This online room is fully occupied by yourself. Nobody can take it. Whenever you want to show something, the room is just there. So if you are interested in what I am working on, although the SIGCOMM conference has ended, you can still feel free to stop by my VR room and take a look at my work.\nHere is the link to my poster VR room: https://hub.link/wjYrtZ3\nI put the original PDF files of the 2-page abstract and the A0 poster in this room. You can feel free to download them without my approval. If you have any questions, just drop me an email to jensen@jensen-zhang.site.\nYou can also send me an email to request a slot if you want a VR chat. I can meet you in the VR room and talk to you about my work online. Don\u0026rsquo;t be shy.

BGP, the de facto interdomain routing protocol, provides no programmable control. Recent proposals for interdomain control, such as MIRO, ARROW and SDX, provide more mechanisms and interfaces, but they are only either point or incremental solutions. In this paper, we provide the first, systematic formulation of the software-defined internetworking (SDI) model, in which a network exposes a programmable interface to allow clients to define the interdomain routes of the network, just as a traditional SDN switch exposes Openflow or another programmable interface to allow clients to define its next hops, extending SDN from intra-domain control to generic interdomain control. Different from intradomain SDN, which allows complete client control, SDI should also maximize network autonomy, such as by allowing a network to maintain the control of its interdomain export policies, to avoid fundamental violations such as valley routing. We define the optimal end-to-end SDI routing problem and conduct rigorous analysis to show that the problem is NP-hard. We develop a blackbox optimization algorithm, which leverages Bayesian optimization theory and important properties of interdomain routing algebra, to sample end-to-end routes sequentially and find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route with a small number of sample routes. We implement a prototype of our optimization algorithm and validate its effectiveness via extensive experiments using real interdomain network topology. Results show that in an interdomain network with over 60000 ASes and over 320000 AS-level links, in 80% experiment cases, the blackbox optimization algorithm can find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route by sampling less than 33 routes.","tags":["Routing","Optimization","Linear programming","IP networks","Pricing","Systematics","Routing protocols"],"title":"Toward Optimal Software-Defined Interdomain Routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I have read a bunch of research papers in the past few years.

By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. We also give a full demonstration of the Unicorn system at SuperComputing 2017.","tags":[],"title":"Unicorn: Unified Resource Orchestration for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiao Xiang","J.

However, a major lack of existing systems is their coarse granularity, due to the participating networks' concern of revealing sensitive information, which can result in substantial inefficiencies. This paper presents Mercator, a novel multi-domain network resource discovery system to provide fine-grained, global network resource information, for collaborative sciences. The foundation of Mercator is a resource abstraction through algebraic-expression enumeration (i.e., linear inequalities/equations), as a compact representation of the available bandwidth in multi-domain networks. In addition, we develop an obfuscating protocol, to address the privacy concerns by ensuring that no participant can associate the algebraic expressions with the corresponding member networks. We also introduce a super-set projection technique to increase Mercator's scalability. Finally, we implement Mercator and demonstrate both its efficiency and efficacy through extensive experiments using real topologies and traces.","tags":["Bandwidth","Servers","Routing protocols","Privacy","Scalability","Network topology"],"title":"Fine-Grained, Multi-Domain Network Resource Abstraction as a Fundamental Primitive to Enable High-Performance, Collaborative Data Sciences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Gao","Jingxuan Zhang","Y.

As a result, the ability to predict the available bandwidth for a set of flows has become a fundamental requirement of today's networking systems. While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we identify three challenges in providing throughput prediction for reactive flows: throughput dynamics, heterogeneous reactive control mechanisms, and source-constrained flows. Based on a previous theoretical model, we introduce a novel learning-based prediction system with a key component named fast factor learning (FFL) model. We adopt novel techniques to overcome practical concerns such as scalability, convergence and unknown system parameters. A system, Prophet, is proposed leveraging the emerging technologies of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to realize the model.
