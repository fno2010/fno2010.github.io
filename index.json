In particular, the provided-aided network information can help applications orchestrate their traffic for a better quality of experience, and is gaining a lot of attention from both the academia and the industry. However, enabling automated network-aware application optimization in todayâ€™s Internet is difficult because of the multivendor, multi-domain nature of carrier networks. In this paper, we introduce Sextant, a novel network information exposure system, taking a solid step towards enabling network-aware application optimization in carrier networks. Our work is driven by a real requirement from an international ISP, where timely, accurate distance information is critical to fully utilize its CDN caches deployed at different Point-of-Presence (PoP). We design a novel, flexible requirement model, allowing applications to specify their interests. The queries are efficiently carried out using our aggregation and incremental update algorithms. Evaluations demonstrate that our prototype system operates on top of real router software images, and can efficiently handle dynamics from multiple ASes.","tags":["network-awareness","ISP-CDN collaboration"],"title":"Sextant: Enabling Automated Network-aware Application Optimization in Carrier Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yichao Chen","Ning Luo","Jingxuan Zhang","Timos Antonopoulos","Ruzica Piskac","Qiao Xiang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616725150,"objectID":"eae1bf224fe3d1f541ec02e540f5ccc8","permalink":"/publication/spp-infocom/","publishdate":"2021-03-26T02:19:10.472732Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spp-infocom/","section":"publication","summary":"The stable path problem (SPP) is a unified model for analyzing the convergence of distributed routing protocols (e.g., BGP), and a foundation for many network verification tools. Although substantial progress has been made on finding solutions (i.e., stable path assignments) for particular subclasses of SPP instances and analyzing the relation between properties of SPP instances and the convergence of corresponding routing policies, the non-trivial challenge of finding stable path assignments to generic SPP instances still remains. Tackling this challenge is important because it can enable multiple important, novel routing use cases. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce a novel data structure called solvability digraph, which encodes key properties about stable path assignments in a compact graph representation. Thus SPP is equivalently transformed to the problem of finding in the solvability digraph a maximum independent set (MIS) of size equal to the number of autonomous systems (ASes) in the given SPP instance. We leverage this key finding to develop a heuristic polynomial algorithm GREEDYMIS that solves strictly more SPP instances than state-of-the-art heuristics. We apply GREEDYMIS to designing two important, novel use cases: (1) a centralized interdomain routing system that uses GREEDYMIS to compute paths for ASes and (2) a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) protocol that allows ASes to use GREEDYMIS collaboratively to compute paths without exposing their routing preferences. We demonstrate the benefits and efficiency of these use cases via evaluation using real-world datasets.","tags":[],"title":"Looking for the Maximum Independent Set: A New Perspective on the Stable Path Problem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingxuan Zhang","Kai Gao","Y.

As a result, the ability to predict the available bandwidth for a set of flows has become a fundamental requirement of today's networking systems. While there are previous studies addressing the case of non-reactive flows, the prediction for reactive flows, e.g., flows managed by TCP congestion control algorithms, still remains an open problem. In this paper, we take the first step to solving this problem in a data center network. To address both theoretical and practical challenges, we introduce a novel learning-based prediction system based on the NUM model, with two key techniques named fast factor learning (FFL) and efficient flow sampling. We adopt novel techniques to overcome practical concerns such as scalability, convergence and unknown system parameters. A system, Prophet, is proposed leveraging the emerging technologies of Software Defined Networking (SDN) to realize the model.

The time slots were friendly to me, as I was still stuck in US. But I believe they were not to many people in Asia.\nOverall, such a experiencement is interesting enough, although some of my audiences failed to join the VR room. I guess they were using some lower performance cellphones.\nThe SRC is also interesting enough. I met 3 or 4 jurors. Some of them did not just ask questions, but also gave some helpful comments. I really appreciate.\nI believe a major benefit of using the online room is that there is no limit about the place. It does not mean the room can hold unlimited number of audiences. It means the time slot is unlimited. This online room is fully occupied by yourself. Nobody can take it. Whenever you want to show something, the room is just there.

BGP, the de facto interdomain routing protocol, provides no programmable control. Recent proposals for interdomain control, such as MIRO, ARROW and SDX, provide more mechanisms and interfaces, but they are only either point or incremental solutions. In this paper, we provide the first, systematic formulation of the software-defined internetworking (SDI) model, in which a network exposes a programmable interface to allow clients to define the interdomain routes of the network, just as a traditional SDN switch exposes Openflow or another programmable interface to allow clients to define its next hops, extending SDN from intra-domain control to generic interdomain control. Different from intradomain SDN, which allows complete client control, SDI should also maximize network autonomy, such as by allowing a network to maintain the control of its interdomain export policies, to avoid fundamental violations such as valley routing. We define the optimal end-to-end SDI routing problem and conduct rigorous analysis to show that the problem is NP-hard. We develop a blackbox optimization algorithm, which leverages Bayesian optimization theory and important properties of interdomain routing algebra, to sample end-to-end routes sequentially and find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route with a small number of sample routes. We implement a prototype of our optimization algorithm and validate its effectiveness via extensive experiments using real interdomain network topology. Results show that in an interdomain network with over 60000 ASes and over 320000 AS-level links, in 80% experiment cases, the blackbox optimization algorithm can find a near-optimal policy-compliant end-to-end route by sampling less than 33 routes.","tags":["Routing","Optimization","Linear programming","IP networks","Pricing","Systematics","Routing protocols"],"title":"Toward Optimal Software-Defined Interdomain Routing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I have read a bunch of research papers in the past few years.

By analyzing the data analytics trace from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, one of the largest scientific experiments in the world, and systematically examining the design of existing resource management systems for clusters, we show that the multi-domain, geo-distributed, resource-disaggregated nature of this new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources, with the objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of different domains, and that the fundamental challenge for designing such a framework is: how to accurately discover and represent resource availability of a large set of distributively-owned, heterogeneous resources across different domains with minimal information exposure from each domain? Existing resource management systems are designed for single-domain clusters and cannot address this challenge. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified resource orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics. In Unicorn, we encode the resource availability for each domain into resource state abstraction, a variant of the network view abstraction extended to accurately represent the availability of multiple resources with minimal information exposure using a set of linear inequalities. We then design a novel, efficient cross-domain query algorithm and a privacy-preserving resource information integration protocol to discover and integrate the accurate, minimal resource availability information for a set of data analytics jobs across different domains. In addition, Unicorn also contains a global resource orchestrator that computes optimal resource allocation decisions for data analytics jobs. We implement a prototype of Unicorn and present preliminary evaluation results to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy. We also give a full demonstration of the Unicorn system at SuperComputing 2017.","tags":[],"title":"Unicorn: Unified Resource Orchestration for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiao Xiang","Jingxuan Zhang","Xin Wang","Yang Liu","Chin Guok","Franck Le","John MacAuley","Harvey Newman","Y.

The foundation of Mercator is a resource abstraction through algebraic-expression enumeration (i.e., linear inequalities/equations), as a compact representation of the available bandwidth in multi-domain networks. In addition, we develop an obfuscating protocol, to address the privacy concerns by ensuring that no participant can associate the algebraic expressions with the corresponding member networks.
