For each particular existing work, we try to figure out the following questions:\n What is its design space?  In its design, which information is required to be fed by applications? In its design, which information is required to be exposed by the network?  What is its potential issues?  If possible, how easily can it be extended to other use cases? Why it cannot work well in some cases?   Related Works As a starting point, we collect related works published on CoNEXT, SOSP, NSDI, and SIGCOMM from 2007 to 2019.\nThe current literate review covers papers in the following list. And the list may grow in the future, if we find more highly related works.\n Review Cards Wiser High-level Goal: design a practical interdomain routing protocol that enables ISPs to jointly control routing and compute good end-to-end paths while acting in their own interest.\n$$ \\text{cost}I = \\min{paths} (\\sum_{p \\in paths} \\text{traffic}_I(p) \\times \\text{intcost}_I(p)) $$\n   Symbol Description     $I$ An ISP   $paths$ All possible end-to-end paths   $\\text{cost}_I$ Expected external cost for ISP $I$   $\\text{traffic}_I(p)$ The rate of traffic carried along path $p$ over some period   $\\text{intcost}_I(p)$ The internal cost of path $p$ in ISP $I$    Basic Idea: Each ISP estimate its own external cost and advertise to its neighbors the total cost to reach the destination.

First time, I participated SRC (Student Research Competition) in SIGCOMM. First time, I presented a poster in a Hubs VR room.\nYes, SIGCOMM poster/demo committee decided to use Mozilla Hubs to present each poster/demo online this year. Each author was required to host a Hubs VR room and present his/her work in his/her own VR room online. What does it mean? It means more workload! You have to set up a VR room besides your pre-print A0 poster.\nThe SIGCOMM poster/demo session took place over August 11-12 from 4:30pm-5:30pm ET. The time slots were friendly to me, as I was still stuck in US. But I believe they were not to many people in Asia.\nOverall, such a experiencement is interesting enough, although some of my audiences failed to join the VR room. I guess they were using some lower performance cellphones.\nThe SRC is also interesting enough. I met 3 or 4 jurors. Some of them did not just ask questions, but also gave some helpful comments. I really appreciate.\nI believe a major benefit of using the online room is that there is no limit about the place. It does not mean the room can hold unlimited number of audiences. It means the time slot is unlimited. This online room is fully occupied by yourself. Nobody can take it. Whenever you want to show something, the room is just there. So if you are interested in what I am working on, although the SIGCOMM conference has ended, you can still feel free to stop by my VR room and take a look at my work.\nHere is the link to my poster VR room: https://hub.link/wjYrtZ3\nI put the original PDF files of the 2-page abstract and the A0 poster in this room. You can feel free to download them without my approval. If you have any questions, just drop me an email to jensen@jensen-zhang.site.\nYou can also send me an email to request a slot if you want a VR chat. I can meet you in the VR room and talk to you about my work online. Don\u0026rsquo;t be shy. Maybe we can be very good friends.\n","date":1598306400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598306400,"objectID":"b9c325980152ea6719bbbce6ae25973f","permalink":"/post/sigcomm2020-poster-present/","publishdate":"2020-08-24T18:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/sigcomm2020-poster-present/","section":"post","summary":"2020 is an amazing year when we experienced many many \u0026ldquo;first times\u0026rdquo;.

Transparent computing is an implementation of ubiquitous computing that is aimed at providing active services for users. In transparent computing, the execution (computation) of computer instructions and data is temporally and spatially separated from their storage. Cloud computing solves the issue of data cloudlization, while transparent computing solves the one of software cloudlization. This paper define the concept of Cloudware, and discusses how to deploy Cloudware in cloud environment efficiently. Based on a loosely coupled von Neumann computing model (also called Cygnus Model), we proposes a new platform to construct the PaaS platform which can directly deploy software on the cloud without any modification, while achieving a new model by the browser services, and we call it transparent computing 2.0. By using micro-service architecture, we can achieve such characteristics as good performance, scalable deployment, faults tolerance and flexible configuration. Finally, we presents a Cloudware PaaS platform prototype, called CloudwareHub, and demonstrates the promising of the transparent computing 2.0 with the support of Cloudware technology.","tags":["Cloud computing","Cloudware","Service","Transparent computing"],"title":"Towards an Emerging Cloudware Paradigm for Transparent Computing","type":"publication"}]
