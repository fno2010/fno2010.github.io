      <description>Recently, my research interest moves to NAI (Network-Application Integration), which we think will become a hot direction of networking systems in the next few years. While it is not a totally new topic, because of emerging application service architectures (e.g., CDN, MEC, Live Video Streaming, Cloud Gaming) and networking architectures (e.g., Programmable Dataplane, SD-WAN, Segment Routing, New IP), previous works may not work very well.
To better understand new challenges on this direction, we make this literate review.</description>
