      <description>I have read a bunch of research papers in the past few years. But I fail to remember most of them because of the lack of summary and better organization. It is time to resume the research reading list for myself.
Although there are already several very good public reading lists about computer networking, e.g., Cristian Lumezanu&amp;rsquo;s SDN Reading List and Richard Yang&amp;rsquo;s Lecture, they are so general that they do not match my research interests very well.</description>
